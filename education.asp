  <p style="text-align:center;font-family:courier;color:Silver;">
   I'm a senior at FCS, where I've gone since kindergarten. Going to a small Christian school, I've been involved in volleyball, track,
   cheerleading, chapel committee, Senior Council, orchestra, and Honor Society. At FCS I found my passions, my faith, and my friends.

  <p style="text-align:center;font-family:courier;color:Silver;">
   Next year I plan to attend GCU in Phoenix, Arizona. I fell in love with the school because of the warm weather, potential 
   adventures, countless opportunities, and mixture of Christian atmosphere + real world interactions. I will study Spanish as an Honors student, possibly 
   alongside data analytics.
