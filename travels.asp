 <h3 style="text-align:center;font-family:georgia;color:Silver;">Tirana, Albania</h3>
  <p style="text-align:center;font-family:courier;color:Silver;">
  The summer after my freshman year, I went on my first mission trip. My youth group was going to Tirana, Albania, where we met up with 
  a local church to offer our help and support. After a week spending time with the youth group, helping out with various projects, and 
  sightseeing, we headed into the mountains to run a week-long youth camp. We were all camp counselors, and I was with the middle-school 
  aged girls. We made lots of close friends and got to witness lives changed by the Gospel. After that trip, I knew I wanted to spend more 
  of my time and effort sharing the Good News of Christ, not just around the world, but even in my own commmunity. The next summer, I went 
  back to Albania and saw God prove His faithfulness to us yet again and in countless ways.

 <h3 style="text-align:center;font-family:georgia;color:Silver;">Mexico City</h3>
  <p style="text-align:center;font-family:courier;color:Silver;">
  The winter in between my two trips to Albania, I went to Mexico City with a group from school. We stayed with missionaries in the city 
  and ran sports camps at the local parks and elementary schools. While I experienced a greater language barrier than I did in Albania, 
  we bonded with many of the kids and were able to encourage their walk with Christ. My favorite memory was playing Four Square in the 
  church courtyard with the students from youth group; even though we couldn't understand each other, we all had a blast.

 <h3 style="text-align:center;font-family:georgia;color:Silver;">Washington DC</h3>
  <p style="text-align:center;font-family:courier;color:Silver;">
  My junior year, I participated in an essay competition to be a part of a trip to Washington DC during senior year. Myself, eight other 
  students, and two teachers packed up in the van to head East. We experienced everything from Pennsylvania scrapple, to exclusive tours 
  of the Eisenhower building and the Cabinet offices. In a way, this trip symbolized to me both the adventures that come with senior year,
  and the world I can look forward to being a part of post-graduation.
